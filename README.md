A password strength checker is a tool that evaluates how strong a password is by analyzing its syntax and comparing it to known criteria. The results can help you determine if your password is strong enough to protect your online accounts and personal information. 

Here are some tips for using a password strength checker:
 
Check your password:-
Use a password strength checker to determine if your password is strong enough. 

Create a strong password:-
A strong password is long, random, and complex. It should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using common keyboard patterns, acronyms, repeating characters, or words found in a dictionary.  
Don't share your password
Never share your password or send it in an email.
